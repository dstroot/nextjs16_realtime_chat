## To Do

- [ ] Use Shadcn UI Components
- [ ] Support light/dark/system Theme
- [ ] Change from local storage to session storage (don't want any data saved beyond a session)
- [ ] The username is not used in the chat (you appear as "you") so we don't need to show it on the landing page.
- [ ] Username can simply be a nanoid. No need for any extra complexity.
- [ ] Room destruction messages/Errors now disappear after a delay.
- [ ] Consolidated constants into a single file in /lib (constants.ts)
- [ ] Added end-to-end encryption from @oguzbits pull request
