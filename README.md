This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## To Do

- [ ] Use Shadcn UI Components
- [ ] Support light/dark/system Theme
- [ ] Change from local storage to session storage (don't want any data saved beyond a session)
- [ ] Since the username is not actually used in the chat (you appear as "you") we don't need to show it on the landing page.
- [ ] Username can simply be a nanoid. No need for any extra complexity.
- [ ] Room destruction messages/Errors now disappear after a delay.
- [ ] Consolidated constants into a single file in /lib (constants.ts)
